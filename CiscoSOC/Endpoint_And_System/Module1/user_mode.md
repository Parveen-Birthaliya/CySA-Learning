# Windows OS Architecture: User Mode

## Overview

User mode processes are specific to user activity within the Windows operating system. These processes operate within isolated memory spaces to maintain security and stability. This isolation ensures that one user’s process cannot access or corrupt another’s. 

Although isolated, Windows provides well-defined APIs that allow controlled inter-process communication. This safeguards system integrity by limiting privilege escalation and preventing arbitrary memory access between processes.

User mode operates at a lower privilege level than kernel mode to enforce a strict separation between user-level operations and core system functions.

## Categories of User Mode Processes

Windows defines four general categories of user mode processes:

### 1. Non-Service Processes

These are fixed processes initiated by user activity rather than the system's service control manager. They typically provide essential support for user access to system resources.

**Examples:**
- Session Manager (`smss.exe`)
- Logon process (`winlogon.exe`)

### 2. Service Processes

These processes support user system requirements and are generally launched by the service control manager. Unlike system services, they are often user-context aware.

**Examples:**
- Task Scheduler
- Print Spooler (`spoolsv.exe`)

### 3. User Applications

Processes required to run applications explicitly launched by the user.

**Examples:**
- Microsoft Word
- Google Chrome
- Python interpreter

### 4. Operating System Environment Support

Originally, Windows NT supported multiple environment subsystems (Windows, POSIX, OS/2) to promote code portability. Modern Windows versions focus on enhanced POSIX support through the **Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA)** and **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

This component dynamically loads the appropriate subsystem based on application requirements.

## Interaction with Kernel Mode

User mode applications frequently require access to system-level resources—such as file I/O or network sockets—which are managed in kernel mode. 

To handle these interactions securely:

- The system performs a **context switch** from user mode to kernel mode.
- A **kernel interface layer** (e.g., `ntdll.dll`, system call dispatchers) mediates the request.
- Once the operation is complete, the system returns to user mode.

This separation is fundamental to Windows security architecture, ensuring that user-mode code cannot directly interfere with system-critical kernel operations.

| Aspect                     | User Mode                              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Privilege Level            | Low                                      |
| Memory Isolation           | Yes (per process)                        |
| Access to Hardware         | Indirect, via kernel interfaces          |
| Typical Components         | Apps, Services, Subsystem Managers       |
