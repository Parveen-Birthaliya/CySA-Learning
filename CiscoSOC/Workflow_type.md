# SOC Workflow Types

## Overview

Workflows in a Security Operations Center (SOC) coordinate tasks between personnel and synchronize data between systems to enhance efficiency and incident response.

## Types of Workflows

### 1. Sequential Workflow
- Progresses in a fixed order, step by step.
- Does not allow moving backward.
- Simple and linear in structure.
- Commonly used for routine incident handling.

### 2. State Machine Workflow
- Moves between defined states.
- Can return to a previous state if needed.
- Suitable for complex or adaptive processes.

### 3. Rules-Driven Workflow
- Based on a sequential workflow.
- Progress dictated by predefined rules or conditions.
- Enables decision-based task execution.

## Role of WMS (Workflow Management System)

A WMS defines, controls, and monitors tasks and activities in a workflow. It ensures the structured execution of SOC processes and supports measurement for continuous improvement.
