# Incident Response Workflow

## Overview

A consistent and well-defined incident response workflow is essential to ensure that security events are handled based on their severity and organizational impact. Severity levels must have predefined handling procedures, and the workflow must account for changes in severity over time.

The goal is to ensure:
- Defined response based on incident severity
- Timely and consistent reporting throughout the lifecycle
- Automated processes where possible using WMS tools

## Workflow Lifecycle

1. **Preparation** – Establish policies, communication channels, and tools.
2. **Detection & Analysis** – Identify potential incidents, triage alerts, and confirm incidents.
3. **Containment** – Limit the spread of the incident and isolate affected systems.
4. **Eradication** – Remove the root cause and any traces of the threat.
5. **Recovery** – Restore systems to normal operation.
6. **Post-Incident Activity** – Perform lessons learned, reporting, and update playbooks.

## Role of SOC WMS

A Security WMS automates parts of the incident response process to reduce manual overhead and increase reliability. It ensures:
- Alert generation for missed reporting deadlines
- Enforcement of reporting timelines
- Streamlined shift handovers with maintained incident context

## Incident Response Roles in SOC

| **Role**                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tier 1 Analyst**              | Monitors alerts, triages events, ensures sensor/endpoint health, and collects context for Tier 2 analysis.                                       |
| **Tier 2 Analyst**              | Performs deep analysis, correlates logs, confirms breach impact, advises remediation, and develops new detection techniques.                      |
| **Incident Response Handler**   | Owns the incident lifecycle, executes containment, ensures SOP adherence, and communicates updates with stakeholders.                             |
| **Forensics Specialist**        | Collects, preserves, and analyzes digital evidence to support investigations while maintaining data integrity.                                    |
| **Malware Reverse Engineer**    | Dissects malware, identifies behaviors, creates IOCs/signatures, and supports threat hunting and prevention efforts.                              |
| **SOC Management**              | Manages personnel, budgets, scheduling, and tools; ensures SLA compliance and acts as liaison for high-severity incidents.                        |
| **Executive Leadership**        | Sets strategic direction, ensures alignment with business goals, and evaluates SOC performance against objectives.                               |

## Key Takeaways

- Every severity level must have a predefined, structured response.
- Response workflows should support dynamic severity reclassification.
- WMS helps maintain consistent documentation and timely incident handling.
- Tiered analyst structure ensures scalability and role specialization.
