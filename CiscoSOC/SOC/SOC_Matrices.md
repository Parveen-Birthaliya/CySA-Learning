# SOC Metrics

Enterprises today invest over **US$100 billion annually** in cybersecurity tools, personnel, and processes. However, higher spending doesnâ€™t always translate to secured outcomes. An **effective threat-centric SOC** is characterized by:

- **Deep expertise**
- **Cutting-edge technology**
- **Leading security intelligence**
- **Advanced analytics**

These elements enable the SOC to **detect and investigate threats** with exceptional **speed, accuracy, and focus**.

---

## Key Attributes of SOC Performance

- **Speed**:  
  Faster detection and targeted mitigation reduce the **mean time to respond (MTTR)**.

- **Focus**:  
  Higher fidelity alerts reduce **false positives**, enabling **proper containment** and **actionable remediation**.

- **Accuracy**:  
  Continuous monitoring, investigation, and **full packet capture** uncover **security blind spots**.

## Why Use Metrics?

Metrics help **define, measure, and improve** SOC effectiveness.  
The **Chief Security Officer (CSO)** must select the right **reporting model** aligned with business needs.

Effective metrics should be:

- **Specific**
- **Measurable**
- **Attainable**
- **Relevant**
- **Timely**  

---

## SOC Maturity and Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

As SOC operations **mature**, the **mean time to detect (MTTD)** should trend **downward**.  
> A sustained decrease in MTTD reflects the **effectiveness and maturity** of the SOC.

Note:  
SOC maturity is a **long-term process**; improvements in metrics may take **years** to manifest.

## Typical SOC Metrics

Below are common **SOC performance metrics** used to demonstrate value to the business:

- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** after incident occurrence
- **Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)** after detection
- **Mean Time to Mitigate (MTTM)** after containment
- **Number of incidents** detected, contained, and mitigated
- **Percentage of incidents** discovered using plays from the SOC playbook
- **Number of new plays** added to the playbook
- **Number of zero-day attacks** detected
- **False positive vs. true positive** detection rate
- **Operational cost** of running the SOC

---

## Incident Timeline Metrics

A **linear timeline approach** is used to measure **incident response** stages.  
Key stages and metrics include:

- **Time to Detect**
- **Time to Report**
- **Time to Contain**
- **Time to Mitigate**

> ðŸ•’ **Time to Report** is included in **dwell time**, which measures how long an attacker remains undetected in the environment.

---

By using these metrics, the SOC can **quantitatively demonstrate value**, drive **continuous improvement**, and align better with **business objectives**.
