### Anomalous Activity
- Defination: Unusual computer behavior
  - Unexpected network traffic/spikes
  - Abnomal CPY/memory usage
  - Suspicious user actions.
  - Unpredictable system events
- Importance of establishing a "normal" behavior baseline.

### New Account Creation
- Purpose: To bypass security or mask actions
- Threat types: External attackers or insider threats
- Examples: "Ghost" accounts, unauthorised access.
- Note: Not all new accounts are threat (e.g. new staff onboarding)

  ### Unexpected Outputs
Definations: Signs a system may be compromised
  - Strange network activity or IP communications.
  - Mysterious inter-system internactions.
  - Communication with malicious IPs.
  - Unusual communication protocols.
  - Large external data transfers.
  - Interactions during off-hours or with suspicios domains
  - Encrypted or hidden communication.

### Service Interruptions
Defination: Disruptions indicating posssible attacks
Causes:
- Dos Attacks
- Ransomware
- System vulnerablility exploitation
- Insider threats

### Application logs
- Importance: Rich sources of security information
- Usage:
    - Monitor for unusual access
    - Track application changes
    - Detect anomalies
    - Identify security incident souces
    - audit user behavior
